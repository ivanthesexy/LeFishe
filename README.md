# LeFishe 2: Electric Boogaloo

FROM THE CREATORS OF [THE SEXY CALCULATOR](https://github.com/ivanthesexy/hwcalculator) & LeFishe™®© 

I PRESENT TO YOU MY SEXY PEOPLE

THE LeFishe™®© 2.0: Electric Boogaloo!

It's now even more great!

- sexy ui thanks to [avalonia ui](http://avaloniaui.net/)
- cross-platform so you can shut up about not using [wine](https://google.com/search?q=cheap+whiskey+and+piss)
- the funny gets synced from repo so no need to rebuild it every time when someone adds a stupid fucking joke
- if the sync fails the default edibles kicks in so no worries about that
- also the link in ui is a bait it doesnt work go cry about it

**what happened to original project?**

its in the `LeFishe` folder no worries but no one is going to maintain it

it requires .NET Framework 2.0 and still works under wine good now shut up
